We have so far explored the Naive Bayes classifier and logistic regression for solving classification tasks. In this section, we will learn about another tool called support vector machines (SVMs).
While the final algorithm will be similar to logistic regression, SVMs approach the problem from a different perspective.
As we'll soon discover, both logistic regression and SVMs have their own strengths and weaknesses.
Plus, we'll get to see some fun math along the way!

### Support Vector Machines

Consider a binary classification problem with data points $\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ and labels $y^{(i)} \in \{-1, 1\}$.
(We previously used $y^{(i)} \in \{0, 1\}$, but this is just a relabeling for convenience.)
We want to find a hyperplane that separates the two classes.
For the majority of our discussion, we will assume that the data is linearly separable, meaning there exists a hyperplane that can perfectly separate the two classes.

When there is such a separating hyperplane, there are often infinitely many that we can choose from.
The question at the heart of support vector machines is: which hyperplane should we choose?

<center><img src="images/svm_possible_lines.svg" class="responsive-img"></center>

As we've seen in the past, it is not too difficult to find a model that perfectly fits our training data; the real challenge is to find a model that generalizes well to unseen data.
In the context of classification, we may expect that a model that separates the two classes with the largest 'margin of error' will generalize better than one that is very close to the data points.
With this in mind, Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis proposed the idea of support vector machines, which aim to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes.

<center><img src="images/svm_definition.svg" class="responsive-img"></center>

Let's consider a particular hyperplane, defined by the normal vector $\mathbf{w}$ and bias $b$.
The equation of the hyperplane is given by:
$$
\begin{align}
\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x} \rangle - b = 0.
\end{align}
$$

We will define $\mathbf{w}$ and $b$ so that $\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \rangle - b \geq 1$ for all points $\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ in the positive class ($y^{(i)} = 1$) and $\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \rangle - b \leq -1$ for all points in the negative class ($y^{(i)} = -1$).
As we can see in the figure above, such a hyperplane will always exist if the data is linearly separable.
How can we find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin?

### Computing the Margin

For a given $\mathbf{w}$ and $b$, we can see that the margin is the distance between the hyperplane $\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x} \rangle - b = 1$ and the hyperplane $\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x} \rangle - b = -1$.
Let's calculate this distance.

<center><img src="images/svm_margin.svg" class="responsive-img"></center>

Consider a point $\mathbf{z}_1$ on the hyperplane $\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x} \rangle - b = 1$.
Let $\mathbf{z}_2$ be the point on the hyperplane $\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x} \rangle - b = -1$ that is *closest* to $\mathbf{z}_1$.
Because $\mathbf{z}_1$ and $\mathbf{z}_2$ are the closest points to each other on the two hyperplanes, the line connecting them is perpendicular to both hyperplanes.
(Otherwise, we could move along the hyperplane $\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x} \rangle - b = -1$ to find a point $\mathbf{z}_2'$ that is closer to $\mathbf{z}_1$ than $\mathbf{z}_2$, contradicting our assumption that $\mathbf{z}_2$ is the closest point.)
Formally, we can write:
$$
\mathbf{z}_1 - \mathbf{z}_2 = \lambda \bar{\mathbf{w}}
$$
for some scaling $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\bar{\mathbf{w}}$ is the unit normal vector $\frac{\mathbf{w}}{\|\mathbf{w}\|_2}$.
We are interested in the length of this vector $\lambda$.
By our observation above, we can write $\mathbf{z}_1 =  \lambda \bar{\mathbf{w}} + \mathbf{z}_2$.
Then, plugging in $\mathbf{z}_1$ into the hyperplane equation $\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{z}_1 \rangle - b = 1$, we have:
$$
\begin{align}
1 &= \langle \mathbf{w}, \lambda \bar{\mathbf{w}} + \mathbf{z}_2 \rangle - b
\\ &= \langle \mathbf{w}, \lambda \bar{\mathbf{w}} \rangle + \langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{z}_2 \rangle - b
\\ &= \lambda \langle \mathbf{w}, \bar{\mathbf{w}} \rangle - 1
\\ &= \frac{\lambda}{\| \mathbf{w} \|_2} \| \mathbf{w} \|_2^2 - 1.
\end{align}
$$
Rearranging, we have that $\lambda = \frac2{\| \mathbf{w} \|_2}$.
For a given $\mathbf{w}$ and $b$, we now know how to compute the margin. Let's now find the $\mathbf{w}$ and $b$ with the largest margin.

### Constrained Optimization

We can formalize our goal as a constrained optimization problem:
We want to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin, subject to the constraints that all points in the positive class are on one side of the hyperplane and all points in the negative class are on the other side.

Observe that maximizing the margin is equivalent to minimizing the *inverse* of the margin, which, by our calculation above, is equivalent to minimizing $\frac12 \| \mathbf{w} \|_2$.
Further, notice that we can simplify our constraints:
$\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \rangle - b \geq 1 \text{ for } y^{(i)} = 1$
and $\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \rangle - b \leq -1 \text{ for } y^{(i)} = -1$
is equivalent to $ y^{(i)}(\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \rangle - b) \geq 1$ for all $i$.
(This is why we relabelled the classes so that $y^{(i)} \in \{-1, 1\}$.)
We can now write our optimization problem as follows:
$$
\begin{align}
\min_{\mathbf{w}, b} \frac12 \| \mathbf{w} \|_2^2 \textnormal{ such that }
 y^{(i)}(\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \rangle - b) \geq 1 \text{ } \forall i.
\end{align}
$$

The points $\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ that lie on the hyperplane i.e., those for which $y^{(i)}(\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \rangle - b) = 1$ are called the *support vectors*.
Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the set of indices of the support vectors.

<center><img src="images/svm_supports.svg" class="responsive-img"></center>

The problem above is known as an example of a *constrained optimization problem*.
More specifically, it is a *quadratic programming* problem:
we have a quadratic objective function (the term $\frac12 \| \mathbf{w} \|_2^2$ is quadratic in $\mathbf{w}$) and linear constraints (the constraints are linear in $\mathbf{w}$ and $b$).
Constrained optimization problems in general, and quadratic programming in particular, are a rich area of study in optimization, and there are many techniques to solve them.
However, the time complexity of these techniques will depend on the number of variables in $\mathbf{w}$.
For data in high dimensions (e.g., the transformed data after we add features to make the classes linearly separable), the time complexity can be quite high.
In the next section, we will see how to find the *dual* of this problem, which can allow us to solve it more efficiently.

Before we do, let's see why the hyperplane is called a *support vector machine*.

**Claim**: The optimal hyperplane $\mathbf{w}^\star$ is a linear combination of the support vectors:
$$
\mathbf{w}^\star = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \beta_i  y^{(i)} \mathbf{x}^{(i)}
$$
for some coefficients $\beta_i \in \mathbb{R}$.

**Proof**:
Suppose for contradiction that $\mathbf{w}^\star$ is not a linear combination of the support vectors.
That is, $\mathbf{w}^\star = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \beta_i  y^{(i)} \mathbf{x}^{(i)} + \mathbf{v}$ for some vector $\mathbf{v}$ that is orthogonal to all support vectors.
We will construct a new hyperplane $\mathbf{w}' = \mathbf{w}^\star - \epsilon \mathbf{v}$ for some small $\epsilon > 0$, so that each point is still correctly classified, and the margin is larger than that of $\mathbf{w}^\star$.

Let's check that the new hyperplane $\mathbf{w}'$ still correctly classifies all points.
First, for any support vector $\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$, we have 
$$
\langle \mathbf{w}', \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \rangle = \langle \mathbf{w}^\star - \epsilon \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \rangle = \langle \mathbf{w}^\star, \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \rangle
$$
since $\mathbf{v}$ is orthogonal to all support vectors.
By assumption, $\mathbf{w}^\star$ satisfies $y^{(i)}(\langle \mathbf{w}^\star, \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \rangle - b) = 1$.
Second, for any non-support vector $\mathbf{x}^{(j)}$, we have 
$$
\langle \mathbf{w}', \mathbf{x}^{(j)} \rangle = \langle \mathbf{w}^\star - \epsilon \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{x}^{(j)} \rangle = \langle \mathbf{w}^\star, \mathbf{x}^{(j)} \rangle - \epsilon \langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{x}^{(j)} \rangle.
$$
Since $\mathbf{x}^{(j)}$ is not a support vector, we have $y^{(j)} (\langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{x}^{(j)} \rangle - b) > 1$.
Because this inequality is strict, we can choose $\epsilon$ small enough so that $y^{(j)}(\langle \mathbf{w}', \mathbf{x}^{(j)} \rangle - b) = y^{(j)}(\langle \mathbf{w}^\star, \mathbf{x}^{(j)} \rangle - b - \epsilon \langle \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{x}^{(j)} \rangle) > 1$.

Next, let's check that the margin of $\mathbf{w}'$ is larger than that of $\mathbf{w}^\star$.
Since $\mathbf{v}$ is orthogonal to all support vectors, we can write:
$$
\begin{align}
\| \mathbf{w}' \|_2^2 
&= \| \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \beta_i y^{(i)} \mathbf{x}^{(i)} - (1-\epsilon) \mathbf{v} \|_2^2 \\
&= \| \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \beta_i y^{(i)} \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \|_2^2 + (1-\epsilon)^2 \| \mathbf{v} \|_2^2 \\
&< \| \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \beta_i y^{(i)} \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \|_2^2 + \| \mathbf{v} \|_2^2 = \| \mathbf{w}^\star \|_2^2.
\end{align}
$$
Since the length of the normal vector $\mathbf{w}$ is inversely proportional to the margin, we have that the margin of $\mathbf{w}'$ is larger than that of $\mathbf{w}^\star$, a contradiction!

### The Dual Problem

We have derived a quadratic programming problem, which we'll call the *primal problem*:

$$
\begin{align}
\min_{\mathbf{w}, b} \frac12 \| \mathbf{w} \|_2^2 \textnormal{ such that }
 y^{(i)}(\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \rangle - b) \geq 1 \text{ } \forall i \in \mathcal{S}.
\end{align}
$$

In the version above, we only include the constraints for the support vectors $\mathcal{S}$.
Notice that this is sufficient because the remaining points are correctly classified by the hyperplane defined by the support vectors.

The challenge in directly solving the primal is that the number of variables in $\mathbf{w}$ is equal to the number of features, which can be very large especially if we apply feature transformations to the data.
Fortunately, we can turn the *primal* into a *dual problem*, that, roughly speaking, converts each constraint into a variable, and each variable into a constraint.
Notice that this is particularly useful because we only need the constraints for the support vectors, which could be much fewer than the total number of data points $n$.

Let's begin with the *Lagrangian* of the primal problem:
$$
\begin{align}
\min_{\mathbf{w}, b} \max_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} \frac12 \| \mathbf{w} \|_2^2 - \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \alpha_i \left( y^{(i)}(\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \rangle - b) - 1 \right)
= \min_{\mathbf{w}, b} \max_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w}, b, \boldsymbol{\alpha}),
\end{align}
$$
where $\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in \mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{S}|}_+$ is a vector of non-negative real numbers.
Let's see why the Lagrangian is equivalent to the primal problem:
For a particular $\mathbf{w}$ and $b$, the constraints in the primal problem must be satisfied by the Lagrangian, otherwise there is some $i$ such that $y^{(i)}(\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \rangle - b) < 1$ and we can arbitrarily increase the Lagrangian objective by increasing $\alpha_i$.
Among these $\mathbf{w}$ and $b$ that satisfy the constraints, the Lagrangian objective is minimized when $\frac12 \|\mathbf{w}\|_2^2$ is as small as possible, which is equivalent to minimizing the objective of the primal problem.

The Lagrangian is useful because we can more easily reason about the optimal $\mathbf{w}$ and $b$.
Notice that the Lagrangian is a *convex* function in $\mathbf{w}$ and $b$, and a *concave* function in $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$.
Further, as long as the data is linearly separable, we can always come up with a $\mathbf{w}$ and $b$ such that the constraints are satisfied, namely with $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = 0$.
Together, by [Slater's condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slater%27s_condition), we can apply the [minimax theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax_theorem) to exchange the order of the minimization and maximization.
That is,
$$
\min_{\mathbf{w}, b} \max_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w}, b, \boldsymbol{\alpha})
= \max_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} \min_{\mathbf{w}, b} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w}, b, \boldsymbol{\alpha}).
$$

Let's fix a $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ and minimize the Lagrangian with respect to $\mathbf{w}$ and $b$.
Taking the gradient with respect to $\mathbf{w}$ and $b$, and setting it to zero, we have:
$$
\begin{align}
\nabla_{\mathbf{w}} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w}, b, \boldsymbol{\alpha})
&= \mathbf{w} - \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \alpha_i y^{(i)} \mathbf{x}^{(i)} = 0
\\\nabla_{b} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w}, b, \boldsymbol{\alpha})
&= \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \alpha_i y^{(i)} = 0.
\end{align}
$$
Then we have $\mathbf{w} = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \alpha_i y^{(i)} \mathbf{x}^{(i)}$.
Notice that this implies the claim we made earlier: the optimal hyperplane $\mathbf{w}^\star$ is a linear combination of the support vectors, with coefficients $\alpha_i y^{(i)}$.
Further, we have that $\sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \alpha_i y^{(i)} = 0$.
We can plug these two equations into the Lagrangian to obtain 
$$
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w}, b, \boldsymbol{\alpha})
&=
\frac12 \left( \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \alpha_i y^{(i)} \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \right)^2
- \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \alpha_i y^{(i)} {\mathbf{x}^{(i)}}^\top \sum_{j \in \mathcal{S}} \alpha_j y^{(j)} \mathbf{x}^{(j)} 
+ b \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \alpha_i y^{(i)}
+ \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \alpha_i
\\&=
- \frac12 \sum_{i, j \in \mathcal{S}} \alpha_i \alpha_j y^{(i)} y^{(j)} \langle \mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \mathbf{x}^{(j)} \rangle
+ \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \alpha_i.
\end{align}
$$
Finally, the dual problem is given by
$$
\begin{align}
\max_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \alpha_i - \frac12 \sum_{i, j \in \mathcal{S}} \alpha_i \alpha_j y^{(i)} y^{(j)} \langle \mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \mathbf{x}^{(j)} \rangle
\text{ such that } \alpha_i \geq 0 \text{ and } \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}} \alpha_i y^{(i)} = 0.
\end{align}
$$

### Kernel Trick

We have framed support vector machines as a tool that requires linearly separable data.
However, we often need to apply a transformation $\psi: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^D$ to the data to make it linearly separable.
For most kernels, $D$ is very large, and explicitly computing the transformation $\psi(\mathbf{x}^{(i)})$ is infeasible.
Fortunately, we can use the *kernel trick* to compute the inner product without explicitly computing the transformation.
The kernel trick allows us to define a kernel function $K: \mathbb{R^d} \times \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ such that
$$
\begin{align}
K(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \mathbf{x}^{(j)}) = \langle \psi(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}), \psi(\mathbf{x}^{(j)}) \rangle.
\end{align}
$$

For many years, I was confused about why the kernel trick works. Doesn't computing the inner product require us to apply the transformation $\psi$?

Let's see two examples:

**Polynomial Kernel**: Consider the polynomial kernel $K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}') = (\langle \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}' \rangle + 1)^p$ for $p \in \mathbb{N}$.
The explicit transformation $\psi$ when $p=2$ and $d=3$ is given by:
$$
\psi(\mathbf{x}) = \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
\sqrt{2} x_1 \\
\sqrt{2} x_2 \\
\sqrt{2} x_3 \\
x_1^2 \\
x_2^2 \\
x_3^2 \\
\sqrt{2} x_1 x_2 \\
\sqrt{2} x_1 x_3 \\
\sqrt{2} x_2 x_3 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
However, we can efficiently compute the inner product without explicitly computing $\psi$. For example,
$$
\begin{align}
K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}) &= (\langle \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w} \rangle + 1)^2
\\&= (1 + x_1 x_1' + x_2 x_2' + x_3 x_3')^2
\\&= 1 + 2x_1 x_1' + 2x_2 x_2' + 2x_3 x_3' + x_1^2 x_1'^2 + x_2^2 x_2'^2 
\\+& x_3^2 x_3'^2 + 2x_1 x_2 x_1' x_2' + 2x_1 x_3 x_1' x_3' + 2x_2 x_3 x_2' x_3'
\\&= \langle \psi(\mathbf{x}), \psi(\mathbf{x}') \rangle.
\end{align}
$$


**Gaussian Kernel**: Consider the Gaussian kernel $K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}') = e^{-\frac{\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'\|_2^2}{2\sigma^2}}$ for some $\sigma > 0$.
As shown [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function_kernel), the Gaussian kernel can be expressed as an infinite series.
Instead of explicitly computing the transformation $\psi$, we can compute the kernel in $O(d)$ time by computing the inner product $\langle \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}' \rangle$, and then applying the exponential function with a scaling.

### Soft Margin

We have so far assumed that the data is linearly separable.
However, in practice, we may have noisy data or outliers that make it impossible to find a hyperplane that perfectly separates the two classes.
To address this, we can modify our optimization problem to allow for some misclassification.
We can do this by introducing slack variables $\xi_i \geq 0$ for each data point, which allow us to 'relax' the constraints.
The modified optimization problem is given by:

$$
\begin{align}
\min_{\mathbf{w}, b} \| \mathbf{w} \|^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^n \xi_i
\text{ such that }
y^{(i)}(\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \rangle - b) \geq 1 - \xi_i \text{ and } \xi_i \geq 0 \text{ for all } i.
\end{align}
$$

<center><img src="images/svm_soft.svg" class="responsive-img"></center>

The optimal choice of each slack variable satisfies $\xi_i = \max(0, 1 - y^{(i)}(\langle \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{x}^{(i)} \rangle - b))$.
The parameter $C > 0$ controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the misclassification.
Notice that this is equivalent to minimizing the hinge loss, with a $\ell_2$ regularization term.
