  **Instructor**: [R. Teal Witter](https://www.rtealwitter.com/). Please call me Teal.
  
  **Class Times**: We meet Tuesdays and Thursdays. The first section is from 2:45 to 4:00pm and the second section is from 4:15 to 5:30pm.
  
  **Office Hours**: Before I schedule office hours, please fill out this [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/?30832039-a1d3K) so we can find times that work for all of us.
  
  **Participation**: I expect you to engage in class, ask questions, and make connections. To receive credit, please fill out [this](https://forms.gle/zQG3iLAqCDTzDyv98) form after every lecture.

  **Quizzes**:
  There will be short quizzes at the beginning of our Tuesday classes. These quizzes will test your understanding of the problem sets and the concepts from the prior week.

  **Problem Sets**: Your primary opportunity to learn the material will be on problem sets. You may work with others to solve the problems, but you must write your solutions by yourself, and explicitly acknowledge any outside help (websites, people, LLMs).

  **Exams**:
  There will be two midterms: The first is a written exam that covers most of the supervised learning topics. The second is a cumulative verbal exam.

  **Project**: You will complete a project on a topic of your choice. You will write a report and give a presentation to the class. The project is due at the end of the semester.
